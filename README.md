## 💬 About

**Dailylogue** was built with the help of modern web tools and  front-end technologies.  
The concept and code were creatively assembled to help visualize daily habits and reflections in a soft, focused UI.
It was originally made for self-reflection and light personal use, but was later pushed here in case others find it helpful .
